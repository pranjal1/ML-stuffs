#in this task, I will create a data set (like a spiral dataset), and perform classification using 1-hidden layered neural network.
#if I can find a dataset in internet, I will use that as well.

#aim -> use scikit learn to load dataset.
#    -> perform classification using self built 1-layered NN.
#    -> perform visualization using matplotlib and scikit.
